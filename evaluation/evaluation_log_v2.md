## Key Observations

1. **EUR currency handled correctly** — Documents 004 and 007 used EUR. Extractor correctly identified and reported the currency without confusion.

2. **Bilingual documents work well** — Documents 003 and 007 had mixed Spanish/English content. Claude handled both languages seamlessly and even translated Spanish dates automatically.

3. **Extreme values no problem** — Document 009 had 480,500 kg net weight (container shipment). Extracted correctly despite being 100x larger than other documents.

4. **Technical descriptions extracted** — Document 008 had part numbers, component specifications, and technical codes. All extracted accurately.

5. **Claude adds value beyond the prompt** — On multiple documents, Claude included bonus information (Incoterm, port details, payment terms) not explicitly requested. Useful for customs declarations.

6. **Human-in-the-loop warning present** — All extractions included the verification warning. Legal protection working as designed.

## Dataset Progress

- **Current:** 10 / 50 documents labeled
- **Next:** Expand to 30 documents — add varied formats:
  - Scanned PDFs (phone photos)
  - Documents with handwritten annotations
  - Poor quality scans
  - Documents with tables in different layouts
- **Goal:** Find the accuracy floor — where does the extractor start failing?

## Next Steps

1. Deploy Gradio app to Hugging Face Spaces (permanent URL)
2. Test 3 prompt versions — measure before/after accuracy
3. Add LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation (Claude Haiku as critic model)
4. Build automated evaluation script
5. Test on messy/scanned invoices to find accuracy floor
6. Add 20 more documents to reach 30/50
